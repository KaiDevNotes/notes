[GENERAL WORKFLOW]



* Pull last version of target branch to your workstation:

$ git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>


--

* MAKE NECESSARY CHANGES

--


* Add all changes to staging area:

$ git add .


--


* Make commit of the changes:

$ git commit -m "commit-message-text"


--


* Push the commit to remote git server:

$ git push <remote-name> <branch-name>



-----------------------------------------------------------



[BRANCHING]



* Create a new branch with name "branch1" based on branch 
with name "parent-branch" locally and remotely:

$ git checkout parent-branch

$ git checkout -b branch1

$ git push -u <remote-name> branch1


--


* List all branches and see which is already used:

$ git branch -a


--


* Fetch branch which exists on remote server to local area:

$ git fetch <remote-name> <branch-name>


--


* Switch to the necessary branch:

$ git checkout <branch-name> 


--


* Remove branch locally and remotely:

$ git push --delete <remote-name> <branch-name>

$ git branch -d <branch-name>



-----------------------------------------------------------



[REBASING]


Rebasing is about moving our branch from one base commit to another.
E.g. we made branch based on last commit of "master" branch. 
Next we made any development in our branch, but during this process there were 
made several commits into "master" by other developers, so we would like to 
place changes from our branch on top of all changes in "master" or in other 
words to base our branch on the last commit from "master". 


To perform rebase which is described above we should:

1) switch to "master":

$ git checkout master

2) Pull the latest version of "master":

$ git pull <remote-name> master

3) switch to our branch, e.g. "branch1":

$ git checkout branch1

4) perform rebase:

$ git rebase master

5) Resolve merge conflicts if any and then:

$ git add <file(s)-with-resolved-conflicts> 
$ git rebase --continue 

6) Push changes to the remote

$ git push -f origin branch1

The rebase process can be controlled via:

$ git log



-----------------------------------------------------------



[MERGING]



* Merge branch "branch1" with "master" branch:

$ git checkout master

$ git merge branch1

>> confirm or modify merge message and exit "vi" editor via: ESC + :q! + ENTER  

$ git push <remote-name> master



-----------------------------------------------------------



[TAGGING]



A tag is used to label and mark a specific commit in the history or in other 
words TAG is alias to hexadecimal version name (commit).
It is usually used to mark release points (eg. v1.0, etc.).

Although a tag may appear similar to branch, but we cannot change a tag because 
it just points to a specific commit in the history (in any branch).


--


* Create a new tag for current version of current branch you are in:

$ git tag <tag-name>


--


* List all tags

$ git tag


--


* Push locally created tags to remote server:

$ git push <remote-name> --tags

or only specific tag

$ git push <remote-name> <tag-name>


--


* Remove tag locally and remotely:

$ git push --delete <remote-name> <tag-name>

$ git tag -d <tag-name>



-----------------------------------------------------------



[STASHING]



Stash in GIT is an analogy to shelveset in TFS. 
Stash can be used to avoid problems during pulling of the last version of 
code from remote git server.

It means that before commit we should:

1) stash changes (make shelveset - in TFS) which have been made in order to 
implement/fix something

2) pull last version of target branch (get latest version - in TFS)

3) apply changes from stash (unshelve changes - in TFS) 

4) resolve merge conflicts if any

5) add changes to stage 

6) make commit

7) make push to remote git server


--


* Stash changes:

$ git stash save "stash-label-or-message"

or just

$ git stash


--


* View all stashes:

$ git stash list


--


* Show changes associated with last stash

$ git stash show


--


* Apply changes from last stash:

$ git stash apply


--


* Clear all stashes:

$ git stash clear



-----------------------------------------------------------



[UNDOING OF CHANGES]



* Undo all changes in working directory (or in other words "unstaged changes"):

$ git checkout .

or to undo unstaged changes in particular file (e.g. 1.txt)

$ git checkout 1.txt 


--


* Move all changes back from staging area to working directory:

$ git reset .

or move changes in particular file (e.g. 1.txt) from staging area to working directory

$ git reset 1.txt 


--


* Undo staged changes completely (or "git reset" + "git checkout"):

$ git reset --hard


--


* Remove the last not pushed commit and move changes from 
this commit to working directory:

$ git reset HEAD~1


--


* Remove the last not pushed commit with all its changes:

$ git reset --hard HEAD~1


--


* Undo last pushed commit (rollback - in TFS)

$ git revert HEAD

>> confirm or modify revert message and exit "vi" editor via: ESC + :q! + ENTER

$ git push  <remote-name> <branch-name>
