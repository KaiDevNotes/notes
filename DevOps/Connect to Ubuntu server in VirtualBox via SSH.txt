In order to connect to Ubuntu server in VirtualBox via SSH we should configure "port forwarding":

For example our Ubuntu server in VirtualBox has IP 10.0.2.15 (this IP is shown during installation 
Ubuntu on VirtualBox in "Network connections section"). So we should do next:

1) Go to: Machine -> Settings -> Network -> Adapter 1

2) Set "Attached to: NAT"

3) Expand "Advanced"

4) Click "Port Forwarding" button

5) Click "Add" button

6) Create new rule, for example:
Name [ubuntu-server-ssh]
Protocol [TCP]
Host IP [127.0.1.1]
Host Port [22]
Guest IP [10.0.2.15] - IP of our Ubuntu server in VirtualBox
Guest Port [22]

7) Open Putty and create new connection using IP [127.0.1.1] and Port [22]
