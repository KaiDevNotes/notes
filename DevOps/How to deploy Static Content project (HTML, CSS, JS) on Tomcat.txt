To deploy Static Content project (HTML, CSS, JS) on Tomcat we need to:




1) Add necessary <Context> tag into <Host> tag in ..\conf\server.xml file.
It is necessary to note that SC project can be placed in ..\webapps\ directory or 
in any other directory on file system.



1.1 - Example: SC project is placed in ..\webapps\ directory

<Host name="localhost"  appBase="webapps" unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">			
	<Context path="/sc" docBase="sc-app"></Context>
</Host>

In this case all files of SC project should be placed in ..\webapps\sc-app directory.
And of course this project should contain index.html file.



1.2 - Example: SC project is placed in directory on file system

<Host name="localhost"  appBase="webapps" unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">			
	<Context path="/sc" docBase="D:/sc-app"></Context>
</Host>

In this case all files of SC project should be placed in D:\sc-app directory.
And of course this project should contain index.html file.


As a result of this configurations our SC project will be available on http://localhost:8080/sc
as was specified in "path" attribute of <Context> tag.





2) If we want to run our SC project on ROOT context: http://localhost:8080/ we should follow the steps 
described in next article:
