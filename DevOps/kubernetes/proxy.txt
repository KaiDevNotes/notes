Services with [type=ClusterIP] can be accessed from outside of K8s cluster 
via PROXY.


For example, we would like to access [ipprovider-service] from "service-
discovery" example from outside of K8s cluster. As we can see in manifest 
of [ipprovider-service] this service has type=ClusterIP.


In order to access [ipprovider-service] we should:


1) Start K8s proxy on, for example, 8777 port via command:
|
|
$ kubectl proxy --port=8777
|
|


2) Next we should make call to URL which should be created according to the 
next pattern:
|
|
http://localhost:[proxy-port]/api/v1/namespaces/[namespace]/services/[service-name]/proxy/[endpoint]
|
|
In our case the URL would look like:
|
|
http://localhost:8777/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/ipprovider-service/proxy/ip
|
|
