K8s port-forwarding is used in order to provide direct access to a POD 
from outside of K8s cluster.

For example, we would like to provide direct access to a pod which contains 
[ipprovider] application/service, so we should:


1) Find name of appropriate POD via command:
|
|
$ kubectl get pods [-n=<namespace-name>]
|
|
For example, we will use a pod with name "ipprovider-xyz".


2) Find a port on which [ipprovider] application/service is
deployed in the POD from the POD's description:
|
|
$ kubectl describe pod ipprovider-xyz [-n=<namespace-name>]
|
|
For example, the port is 8333


3) Make port-forward to this port via command:
|
|
$ kubectl port-forward pod/ipprovider-xyz 8999:8333 [-n=<namespace-name>]
|
|
As a result the pod will be accessible from outside of K8s cluster on 8999 port.
It means that we can make call to [ipprovider] application/service in the 
ipprovider-xyz POD via URL http://localhost:8999/ip
