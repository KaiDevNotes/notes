Fiddler AutoResponder tool is used as STUB for REAL SERVER, 
it means that Fiddler can respond to requests it receives.


For example, we would like to configure Fiddler to respond to requests 
to [GET http://samplehost.net/v1/books] endpoint with predefined response.


We should perform next steps in order to accomplish this:


1) Intercept real call to [GET http://samplehost.net/v1/books] endpoint


2) Highlight this call in Fiddler


3) Click: File -> Save -> Response -> Entire Response...


4) Modify content of obtained *.txt file (if necessary) and save it 
as *.dat file into C:\Users\{Your_User}\Documents\Fiddler2\Captures\Responses\
directory


5) Restart your Fiddler


6) Create new AutoResponder Rule:

6.1 - Open AutoResponder tab

6.2 - Click "Add Rule"

6.3 - Put URL into top field of "Rule Editor". 
In this case we should put: /v1/books

6.4 - Choose created *.dat file which contains predefined response in bottom 
select box of "Rule Editor"

6.5 - Click "Save"


7) Activate created rule and AutoResponder tool:

7.1 - Make checkbox "Enable rules" checked

7.2 - Make checkbox near necessary rule checked



Now your Fiddler will respond to calls which contain /v1/books in URL 
with your predefined response.
