Prerequisites:
--------------


* FiddlerScript should be updated according to "step 1" 
of ./Manual Configuration.pdf



-----------------------------------------------------------------



For example, we would like to configure Fiddler as PROXY for requests 
to [POST http://samplehost.net/v1/books] endpoint.


We should perform next steps in order to accomplish this:


1) Set empty "Custom Address..." in
Rules --> CUSTOM FORWARDING --> Custom Address...


2) On the module side which makes call to target endpoint 
[POST http://samplehost.net/v1/books] we should change request URL 
in the next way:
|
|
http://[fiddler-host-ip-address]:[fiddler-port]/samplehost.netxyz195/v1/books/
|
|
where we added:
* [fiddler-host-ip-address]:[fiddler-port] 
* xyz195 - at the end of target domain name [samplehost.net]


[fiddler-host-ip-address]:[fiddler-port] - can be obtained using 
./Configuration files/iptoclip.bat

fiddler-port - by default has value 8888

For example:
|
|
http://127.0.1.1:8888/samplehost.netxyz195/v1/books/
|
|
