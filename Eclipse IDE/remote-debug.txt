Remote debug can be useful in case when we are unable to route 
requests from other applications/services from target environment to an 
application which is run in debug mode in IDE on you Laptop/PC, 
e.g. to remotely debug application/service which is run inside K8s pod.


Fortunately we have JDWP protocol which allows us to remotely debug an 
java application which has been started with jdwp agent enabled.


Next steps should be followed in order to perform remote debug:


1) Target application should be run with jdwp agent enabled, e.g.
we would like to start "app.jar" application with jdwp agent enabled on
8999 port:
|
|
$ java "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8999" -jar app.jar
|
|


2) Import project which contains source code of "app.jar" application into 
Eclipse IDE.


3) Configure Remote Debug in "Run / Debug Configurations..."
3.1 - Highlight "Remote Java Application"
3.2 - Click "New launch configuraton" button
3.3 - Choose "Connect" tab
3.4 - Name: name of remote debug configuration
3.5 - Project: project which contains source code of target application
3.6 - Connection Type: Standard (Socket Attach)
3.7 - Host: IP address of host with target application
3.8 - Port: port of jdwp agent (in this example it will be 8999)
3.9 - Check "Allow termination of remote VM"
3.10 -  Choose "Common" tab
3.11 - Check "Debug" under "Display in favorites menu"
3.12 - Click "Apply" button
3.13 - Click "Debug" button
3.14 - Open "Debug" perspective and enjoy debugging
