[+] No boilerplate code and less number of Classes in comparison with 
MAPPING and INHERITANCE approaches; 

[+] Straightforward implementation;


[-] Classes of Domain Objects should implement Serializable, contain JPA 
annotations and additional fields for one-to-many or many-to-one relationships. 
So Domain Objects are coupled with persistence mechanism and dependent on it.
!BUT we can use XML mapping files (orm.xml and so on) in order to avoid using 
JPA annotations in classes of Domain Objects.

[-] Problems related to ORM mechanisms are spread throughout the application 
e.g. we might get a lazy-init exception in our web controller.
