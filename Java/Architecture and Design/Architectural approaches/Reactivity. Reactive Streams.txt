[+] THE REACTIVE MANIFESTO


* "The Reactive Manifesto" defines next requirements for reactive systems:
- Responsive
- Resilient
- Elastic
- Message Driven
Visit next links in order to find more details:
https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/
https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/glossary


* Responsiveness is the main outcome of reactivity usage (B1 p. 30).


* Reactivity is a foundation of "Streaming Architecture" which is about 
the construction of the flow of data processing and transformation. In general,
such a system is characterized by low latency and high throughput. Thus, to 
build such a highly-available system, we have to rely on fundamental principles,
as mentioned in the Reactive Manifesto. 
For example, achieving resilience might be done by enabling backpressure support. 
Backpressure refers to a sophisticated mechanism of workload management between
processing stages in such a way that one stage does not overwhelm another stage.
Efficient workload management may be achieved by using message-driven 
communication over a reliable message broker, which may persist messages
internally and send messages on demand.





[+] REACTIVE STREAM SPECIFICATION


* "Reactive Streams Specification" is a definition of API and rules for 
implementation of reactive approach (reactive libraries):
https://www.reactive-streams.org/
https://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.3-javadoc/org/reactivestreams/package-summary.html


* Reactive Streams specification makes reactive libraries (such as RxJava, 
Project Reactor e.t.c) compatible with each other. 


* Reactive Streams specification resolved the backpressure problem by 
introducing the "pull-push" data exchange model. It means that data items is 
propagated downstream, from publisher to subscriber via Subscriber::onNext(Object)
method, but at the same time, subscription and demand control signals are 
propagated upstream, from a subscriber to a publisher via method 
Subscription::request(long n).
See diagram 4.1 (B1 p. 153) and diagram 3.7 (B1 p. 106) for more details.
See custom subscriber implementation for better understanding of the backpressure 
mechanism usage (B1 p. 165 "Implementing custom subscriber" section).

[+] PROJECT REACTOR


* Project Reactor is the most popular implementation of the Reactive Streams 
specification. 


* Project Reactor supports all common modes of backpressure propagation, 
as follows:

- "push only": When a subscriber asks for an effectively infinite number of 
elements via Subscription::request(Long.MAX_VALUE)

- "pull only": When a subscriber requests the next element only after receiving
the previous one: Subscription::request(1)

- "pull-push" (sometimes called mixed): When a subscriber has real-time control
over the demand and the publisher may adapt to the announced speed of data
consumption.


* It is recommended to extend the BaseSubscriber class provided by Project 
Reactor instead of implementing a custom one.


* Project Reactor provides excellent documentation, including a guide to 
selecting appropriate operators: 
http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator


* Project Reactor is used by Spring Framework 5 for:

- non-blocking reactive http requests processing via WebFlux + Netty
See comparison of non-blocking WebFlux and blocking WebMVC on Diagram 5.1 
(B1 p. 244)

- non-blocking reactive SSE (server-sent events) as lihgtweight alternative 
to WebSocket support

- non-blocking reactive cross-service communication via WebClient and 
WebSocketClient

- non-blocking reactive data access: the Spring Data project provides reactive 
connectivity for MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase e.t.c.

So it is possible to build fully non-blocking reactive application using 
Spring Framework 5.  


* Using Reactor and WebFlux in particular CPU-intensive tasks should be 
scheduled on separate Thread or ThreadPool instances via ::publishOn() or 
::subscribeOn() methods.


* We have to be careful when using methods that, at first glance, look like 
they are I/O operations-free but in fact hide some specific interactions with 
OS (e.g. java.util.UUID.randomUUID()). Without proper attention to such methods,
we may dramatically decrease the entire system's performance. It is, therefore, 
crucial to use only non-blocking operations with Reactor and WebFlux in 
particular.


* "WebFlux + Netty" allows us to handle 20.000 simultaneous requests/users using
cheap hardware e.g. Amazon EC2 (1 virtual CPU, 2 GB RAM) (B1 p. 313)


* Spring Cloud Stream is an easy way to integrate message broker kafka/rabbitmq
with application which is based on Project Reactor and Spring Framework 5 and 
as a result to build distributed reactive system.
It allows backpressure control and other things which are related to reactive 
approach.
