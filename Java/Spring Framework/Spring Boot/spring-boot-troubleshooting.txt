		

[1] Use "--debug" mode in case of problems with auto-configurations as described here:
	https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-troubleshoot-auto-configuration
	It will allow us to see what auto-configurations have been applied.
	
	If it is necessary to see auto-configurations during test run then we can switch on "--debug" mode via 
	class-level annotation: 
	
	@TestPropertySource(properties="debug=true")



[2] Use "-U" flag in order to force Maven to re-download all dependencies during build process.

	mvn clean install -U
