Project [udp-retransmitter] is used in order to demonstrate a way to create 
a custom connection pool. It is simple spring-boot application which retransmits
messages which are received via HTTP call to particular host via UDP protocol.


In this case we create pool of UDP connections (java.net.DatagramSocket) and 
implementation of this pool is based on GenericObjectPool type which is 
provided by "Apache Commons Pool 2" library. 


So using org.apache.commons.pool2.impl.GenericObjectPool we can create pools
of any objects and control their life-cycle in the pool.
