From time to time it is needed to separate ORM mapping metadata and classes of Domain Objects.
For example, when we implement hexagonal, onions or clean architecture.


In such case we can move ORM mapping metadata from classes of Domain Objects to orm.xml file


In Spring Boot application with "spring-boot-starter-data-jpa" starter we need to create orm.xml file
in [project root]\src\main\resources\META-INF\ folder. And this mapping file will be used by Spring Boot 
automatically.


Also it is important to note that we don't have to describe all properties of domain object in 
"/entity/attributes" tag if property name is equal to appropriate column name.
But it is necessary to describe property which represents "id", has Date or Enum type, properties which are used in relationships
ONE-TO-MANY, MANY-TO-ONE, MANY-TO-MANY and so on.
