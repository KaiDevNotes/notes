Description:


Sometimes it is necessary to return data page by page. 
It is convenient for large amount of data and in case 
when data should be presented in table (Table Data).


This example shows configuration of Spring Boot project 
in conjunction with Swagger in order to be able to return 
Pages of data. As we can see it is possible to obtain Page 
from JpaRepository or build Page manually.
