[Byte Buddy] is a code generation and manipulation library for creating and 
modifying Java classes during the runtime of a Java application and without 
the help of a compiler.

In particular it easily allows us to modify 3rd party libraries by creating 
Aspects / Advices using net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent. It means that we 
can modify behaviour of code which is added to our project as dependency 
(compiled JAR).


In this example we modify behaviour of classes/objects from Guava and JodaTime
libraries which are added to project as maven dependencies.
And as we can see [Byte Buddy] works perfectly with static and instance methods,
with public and private methods.
